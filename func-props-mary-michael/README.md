## Make a Menu
list of food items with price in an array stored in this.state.foodItems

two separate arrays, one with foodItems and the other with price need to somehow be tied to one another and also able to easily change elements (i.e. price)

create object (i.e. hamburger) with two key value pairs - name: "hamburger" & price: 5.50


OR tie two arrays together by matching the indexes
